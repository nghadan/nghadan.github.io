	<h1>Nour Ghadanfar</h1>
	<p>Hello. I am a first year Master in City Planning student at the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. I am originally Syrian, but grew up in Kuwait. I went to McGill where I studied sociology and international development. I then moved back to the Middle East and worked in risk assurance for PricewaterhouseCoopers for three years. I absolutely love what I'm learning here at MIT - especially all the coding. Seriously. </p>

	<p> One visualization project that particularly intersted me was one that looked at every total solar eclipse happening in a lifetime. </p>
